# Rest API Middleware
This is an example of a GoLang REST API with some middleware. The intention was to write some middleware that in GoLang to add a trace ID to the incoming HTTP request in order to log it and trace it properly

In addition I wanted to practice more with unit testing and for that reason I've added tests to cover the written functions.

The package structure is made in order to also have the router separated from the main package, this folder is only a placeholder and nothing's in there, but reminder for the future.
